## Documentation

- Latest: https://nasa-nccs-hpda.github.io/eo-validation

## Objectives

- Platform for collaborative validation of remotely sensed data
- Infrastructure to support multi-tenant visualization of moderate to very-high resolution data
- Interactive dashboard for data and validation analysis

## Installation

The following library is intended to be used to accelerate the development of validation products
for remote sensing satellite imagery, or any other applications. eo-validation can be installed
by itself, but instructions for installing the full environments are listed under the requirements
directory so projects, examples, and notebooks can be run.

The original implementation of this tool was implemented with the cloud-based DaskHub environment 
in mind, but additional guidance and installation scripts are provided to support the portability
of the tool on commodity-based and on-premises environments.
