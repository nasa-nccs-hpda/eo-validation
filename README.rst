Objectives
------------

- Platform for collaborative validation of remotely sensed data
- Infrastructure to support multi-tenant visualization of moderate to very-high resolution data
- Interactive dashboard for data and validation analysis

Installation
------------

The following library is intended to be used to accelerate the development of validation products
for remote sensing satellite imagery, or any other applications. eo-validation can be installed
by itself, but instructions for installing the full environment are listed under the requirements
directory so projects, examples, and notebooks can be run.

The original implementation of this tool was implemented with the cloud-based DaskHub environment 
in mind, but additional guidance and installation scripts are provided to support the portability
of the tool on commodity-based and on-premises environments.

**eo-validation** is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/eo-validation/>`__. To install **eo-validation**, run this command in your terminal:

.. code:: python

  pip install eo-validation


**eo-validation** is also available on `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/eo-validation>`__.
If you have `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>`__ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ 
installed on your computer, you can create a conda Python environment to install eo-validation:

.. code:: python

  conda create -n eo-validation-env jupyter ipysheet leafmap geopandas localtileserver rioxarray --channel anaconda --channel conda-forge
  conda activate eo-validation-env
  pip install eo-validation

Optionally, you can install `Jupyter notebook extensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__,
which can improve your productivity in the notebook environment. Some useful extensions include Table of Contents, Gist-it,
Autopep8, Variable Inspector, etc. See this `post <https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231>`__
for more information.       

.. code:: python

  conda install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions -c conda-forge 


If you have installed **eo-validation** before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run the following command in your terminal:

.. code:: python

  pip install -U eo-validation


If you use conda, you can update eo-validation to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:
  
.. code:: python

  conda update -c conda-forge eo-validation
